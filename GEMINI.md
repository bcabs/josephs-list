# Always do the following

- For each request-fulfilled, write out a note w/ a timestamp to the end of Scope.txt that describes what was changed. 
- Feel free to run `git commit` and `git push`

## Things to do next

- [x] 1. Users should not be allowed to select which Group a tool is added to - tools are always added to all groups. (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 2. Keep the default list of displayed tools - but add a search bar for finding specific tools. (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 3. Users need a way to remove or modify their tool listings. (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 4. Tools listings should specify the name of the person who added it. (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 5. Clicking on the name in the tool listing should go to a page that shows the user's email, as well as a listing of all the tools they have added. (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 6. Groups need a "description" field that can be edited by the admin (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 7. Allow users to set and edit a Bio. This should be displayed on the user profile page. (Completed: 2026-01-23)
- [x] 8. Remove the "+" button and the group name buttons - instead, but a "manage Groups". When clicking on that, show a listing of the groups that you are a part of as well as the option to create a group. Clicking on a group should bring you to the Group page that exists now. (Completed: 2026-01-23)

## Things to do later (DO NOT DO NOW - THESE ARE NOTES FOR LATER)

- semantic tool search
- events / work needed / work wanted

## Things we will not do 

- Mark tools as "Available", "Requested", or "Borrowed". This is meant to be coordinated offline, no need to suck users into the app. 

- A log of recent tool additions and borrowing activity in the groups. This is a tool, not a social network.
