St. Joseph's List

## Statement

A community-based tool-sharing website. The idea is to allow users to share tools they own within small, real-world communities that they are a part of. Users can be invited to join specific "groups" and create tool listings that are shown only to other members of the groups that they belong to. 

The following needs to be supported: 

- User account creation w/ email verification
- User "group" creation, with admin privaledges for the "group creator"
- Ability for the admin to invite users via email to join a specific group
- The ability for a user to create a "tool listing" that specifies some text and a picture of the tool that they are willing to lend to other users
- The ability for members of a group to view tool listings across all the groups they are a part of

This website ought to be: 

- Accessable via phone browsers. I don't want an app that needs to be installed (yet) - I just want the website to be very mobile friendly. 
- Hosted in the cloud in as cheap and standard a way possible - minimizing maintenance complexity

## Architecture

- The frontend will be Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- The backend will be Supabase
	- group membership will be implemented using row-based auth
- The site will be hosted on Vercel
